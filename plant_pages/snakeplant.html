        <h2>About Snake Plants</h2>
        <p>Snake Plants, formerly known as Sansevieria and now reclassified as Dracaena, are striking, architectural plants known for their tall, upright leaves with distinctive patterns. They're among the most adaptable and low-maintenance houseplants, making them perfect for beginners or busy plant owners.</p>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>‚ú® <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Snake Plants are one of the best air-purifying plants according to NASA studies. They remove toxins like formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene from indoor air and release oxygen at night, unlike most plants.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="care-section">
        <h2>Light Requirements</h2>
        <p>Snake Plants are incredibly adaptable to various light conditions, from bright indirect light to low light areas.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ideal:</strong> Medium to bright indirect light</li>
            <li><strong>Tolerates:</strong> Low light conditions (but will grow slower)</li>
            <li><strong>Can handle:</strong> Some direct morning sun</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Intense, direct afternoon sunlight which can scorch leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>‚òÄÔ∏è <strong>Tip:</strong> Variegated varieties need more light to maintain their patterns. In low light, they may lose some of their distinctive coloration.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="care-section">
        <h2>Watering Needs</h2>
        <p>Snake Plants are extremely drought-tolerant succulents that prefer to dry out completely between waterings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spring/Summer:</strong> Water when soil is completely dry (typically every 2-4 weeks)</li>
            <li><strong>Fall/Winter:</strong> Reduce watering significantly (possibly once every 1-2 months)</li>
            <li><strong>Warning sign:</strong> Soft, mushy stems or yellowing leaves indicate overwatering, which is the most common issue</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>üíß <strong>Tip:</strong> It's better to underwater than overwater. When in doubt, wait another week before watering.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="care-section">
        <h2>Humidity & Temperature</h2>
        <p>Snake Plants are not fussy about humidity and can tolerate a wide range of temperatures.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Adaptable to normal household humidity (30-50%)</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> 65-85¬∞F (18-29¬∞C) is ideal</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> Can survive brief periods as low as 50¬∞F (10¬∞C)</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Cold drafts and temperatures below 45¬∞F (7¬∞C)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="care-section">
        <h2>Soil & Fertilizer</h2>
        <p>Snake Plants need well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soil mix:</strong> Cactus or succulent mix, or regular potting soil amended with perlite, pumice, or coarse sand</li>
            <li><strong>Pot:</strong> Choose pots with drainage holes</li>
            <li><strong>Fertilizer:</strong> Balanced, diluted houseplant fertilizer (half strength)</li>
            <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Feed 2-3 times during growing season (spring and summer), not during fall and winter</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="care-section">
        <h2>Common Problems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overwatering:</strong> Causes soft, mushy stems, yellowing leaves, and root rot</li>
            <li><strong>Underwatering:</strong> Results in thin, curled leaves and brown tips (rare)</li>
            <li><strong>Pests:</strong> Generally resistant, but can occasionally attract mealybugs or spider mites</li>
            <li><strong>Brown spots:</strong> Often caused by cold damage or water sitting on leaves</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="care-section">
        <h2>Propagation</h2>
        <p>Snake Plants can be propagated through division, leaf cuttings, or rhizome cuttings.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Division:</strong> Separate offsets or pups from the mother plant during repotting</li>
            <li><strong>Leaf cuttings:</strong> Cut a leaf into 2-3 inch sections, making sure to note which end was closest to the soil</li>
            <li><strong>Water propagation:</strong> Place leaf cuttings in water with the bottom end down, changing water weekly</li>
            <li><strong>Soil propagation:</strong> Plant leaf cuttings directly in well-draining soil, keeping slightly moist until roots develop</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>üå± <strong>Note:</strong> Variegated varieties propagated from leaf cuttings may lose their variegation. Division is the most reliable method for maintaining patterns.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
